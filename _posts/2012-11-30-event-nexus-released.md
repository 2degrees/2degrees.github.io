We've been looking into setting up event recording on the [2degrees site](http://www.2degreesnetwork.com/) and found that, although [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) provides a straight-forward interface for events, adding snippets of javascript all over the site would have been a maintenance nightmare.

So, we created a [small framework](https://github.com/2degrees/event-nexus) to wrap up some of quirks of analytics event tracking and to give us a single-point approach to declaring all the events tracking for the site.

So before you launch into writing a load of javascript, which is, essentially, configuration, [check out what we've been up to](https://github.com/2degrees/event-nexus) and hopefully you'll find it useful!

Any suggestions, contributions, etc. most welcome.
