At [2degrees](http://www.2degreesnetwork.com) we've wanted to start giving back to the Open Source Community for some time and today we finally have the first usable project: A Buildout recipe that makes PasteDeploy variables available in Buildout parts ([DeployRecipes](http://packages.python.org/deployrecipes/)).

It is not the first project we make public; it just happens to be the first one to be usable. We've developed the following ones which are very stable, but their documentation is far from complete as of this writing and therefore they have not been announced yet:

- [The Django plugin for `repoze.what`](http://what.repoze.org/docs/plugins/django/)
- A library to make [WSGI a first-class citizen in Django](http://what.repoze.org/docs/plugins/django/)
- A [Python wrapper for Clamd](http://bitbucket.org/Gustavo/pyclamdplus/)

And more projects are coming. Stay tuned!
