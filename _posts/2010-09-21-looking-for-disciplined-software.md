At [2degrees](http://www.2degreesnetwork.com) we're looking for an experienced and disciplined Software Developer to work on the Django-based back-end of our Web site, as well as implement AJAX-based functionality from time to time.

Prior Python, Django or JavaScript experience is desirable but not strictly necessary as we are looking to hire the best Software Developer we find regardless of the technologies they've used in the past.

[Learn more about this position](http://www.2degreesnetwork.com/files/static/downloads/jobs/web-developer.pdf) and contact us if you're interested!
