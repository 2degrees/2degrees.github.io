We're pleased to announce the release of two new Python packages:

- [hubspot-connection](http://pythonhosted.org/hubspot-connection/) provides
a lightweight abstraction layer for making requests to the HubSpot API.
- [hubspot-contacts](http://pythonhosted.org/hubspot-contacts/) is a high-level
library for HubSpot API methods in the Contacts, Contact Lists and Contact
Properties APIs.

Both packages come bundled with testing utilities to help you test code written
on top of them.

Get them while they're hot!
