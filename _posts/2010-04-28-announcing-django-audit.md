As part of some work at 2degrees on ensuring an audit trail for our Django models, we have been working on a project to add under-the-hood auditing to the Django Model class.

We've published an early alpha of this code on [launchpad](https://launchpad.net/django-audit), and hope to have a final release for this package around the end of May to coincide with the deployment of our internal code.

If you can't wait for the documentation, then checkout the code and have a read of the source. Otherwise documentation will be coming along shortly.
