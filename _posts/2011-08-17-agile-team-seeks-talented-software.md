Are you a recent Software Engineering graduate looking to join an Agile team? Or do you have 3 years industry experience and a passion for learning?

We're a fast-paced, well-funded Web 2.0 business looking for a pro-active software developer to join our talented, self-organizing software development team.

### About you

- **You are hungry to learn:** You actively seek change — always looking for opportunities to improve professionally, and to help your team develop. You read software-related publications, welcome criticism of your work and offer your colleagues honest feedback.
- **You're willing to try new things:** Want to try your hand at requirements gathering or UI design? If the idea of becoming a [Generalizing Specialist](http://www.agilemodeling.com/essays/generalizingSpecialists.htm) appeals, this could be the right job for you.
- **You have excellent communication skills:** You're comfortable communicating verbally, graphically or in written text, and you’re happy explaining technical concepts to   non-technical people.
- **You’re qualified and/or experienced:** You have a Software Engineering degree, an equivalent certificate from a leading organization (e.g.: [IEEE-CS](http://www.computer.org/), [BCS](http://www.bcs.org/)) or have at least 3 years experience.
- **You appreciate a sociable, friendly and supportive working environment:** We value technical expertise and encourage developers to exercise their initiative and engage with the business as a whole.This is primarily a Web Development role. Experience or knowledge of Python, Django, GNU/Linux, Git, jQuery, Solr, Postgres and Agile development methodologies</b> is a big plus, but is not required. **We simply want someone with the right attitude** and we'll help you get up to speed with anything you're not familiar with!
