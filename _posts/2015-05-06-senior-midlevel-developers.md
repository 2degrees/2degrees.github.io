[2degrees](http://www.2degreesnetwork.com), the world's leading collaboration
platform for sustainable business, are currently looking for disciplined
software developers to build and maintain Python/Django applications.

We're fundamentally looking for team players who are able to produce
well-crafted software (e.g., elegant design, self-explanatory code), whether
or not they have prior experience with our stack (which we'd consider a big
plus).

To learn more about the software that we build, have a look at the Free
Software projects that we host on
[our GitHub account](https://github.com/2degrees). Recent projects include
[hubspot-contacts](https://github.com/2degrees/hubspot-contacts) and
[python-recaptcha](https://github.com/2degrees/python-recaptcha).

Telecommuting 2-3 days a week is possible, as long as the successful candidates
are able to work in our Oxford office the rest of the time.

To learn more about these vacancies, head over to
[our careers page](https://www.2degreesnetwork.com/about/careers/).
