I'm very pleased to announce that [twod.wsgi](http://packages.python.org/twod.wsgi/) 1.0 has been released, after several months of production use and preview releases! No bug has been found in the release candidate and therefore the final release has the same code as the candidate one.

[twod.wsgi](http://packages.python.org/twod.wsgi/) allows Django developers to take advantage of the [wealth of existing WSGI software](http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&amp;term=wsgi), as the other popular Python frameworks do. It won’t break you existing Django applications because it’s 100% compatible with Django and you can start using the functionality offered by this library progressively.

[Get it](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/twod.wsgi/1.0) while it's hot!
