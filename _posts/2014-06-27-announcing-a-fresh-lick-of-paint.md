title: "Announcing a fresh lick of paint for the 2degrees Developers blog"

Today we're re-launching our developer blog with a fresh lick of paint and a new underlying technology - [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

All of our old posts have been migrated over to this new Jekyll-powered blog and we're now using [Disqus](http://disqus.com) for comments.

As the codebase for the blog now [exists on GitHub](https://github.com/2degrees/2degrees.github.io), if you notice any issues, or can think of any way to improve the design/features of the blog, feel free to fork us and send a pull request!

We'll be continuing to improve this blog, between our sprints, and whenever we have a new Open-Source project to announce.
