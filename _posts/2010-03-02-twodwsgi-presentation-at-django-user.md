Last week I had the pleasure to present [twod.wsgi](http://packages.python.org/twod.wsgi/), a library to improve WSGI support in Django, at the [Django User Group in London](http://londonpython.eventwax.com/djugl-february). The slides are now available in [OpenDocument](http://gustavonarea.net/files/talks/twodwsgi-djugl.odp) and [PDF](http://gustavonarea.net/files/talks/twodwsgi-djugl.pdf) formats.

That day I used a demo application which we are going to publish, possibly on Bitbucket.

We should be releasing twod.wsgi **very soon**, as soon as the documentation is finished. So stay tuned!
